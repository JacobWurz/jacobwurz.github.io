							<h5>
							I worked at BevMo from 8/25/16 to 10/7/21.
							</h5>
							<h5>
							I flexed my college skills at BevMo through my closing notes.<br> 
							And these closing notes are proof of my work ethic and claims on my resume.
							</h5>

							<h5>
							<br><br>I would come in for a 7p-3a and be given tasks by my manager.

							<h5>
							And I had opportunities to use my degree through analyzing data and spreadsheets,
							looking at employees Pack Times for orders and rearranging the store to optimize times.<br>
							I also had to figure out solutions to improve customer "Unhappiness". 
							<br> <img alt="awards" src="../Portfolio/3.gif"

							</h5>
							
							<h5>
							I also acted as dispatch for our 1099 drivers, guiding them to their destination through calling them or through Slack. <br>
							And my inexperience in retail management was an advantage in preventing misclassification
							of our contracted drivers.
							<br> <img alt="awards" src="../Portfolio/4.gif"
							width="800" height="690"> <br>
							</h5>
							
							<h5>
							<br>I also had to create a loyal driver base from scratch so we

<h2>Senior Project</h2>
	<h5>
		My senior project involved working with 5 other colleagues over a course of a year. <br>
		<br>
		One of our group members, Jared, knew our client by asking him to coffee after our client <br>
		gave a speech at CSUS. This led to him giving us a project on private encryption. <br>
		<br>
		Our client wanted to be able to hide any type of file through an algorithm he designed by masking it as a ".khn" file. <br>
		His algorithm involved taking a file into an array of bits, shifting the bits by XOR'ing them with a key, <br>
		then putting them into his own personal algorithm, and outputting it as a .khn file. <br>
		<img alt="awards" src="../Portfolio/senior_1.gif"
							width="500" height="375"> <br>
		For decrypting this was the same process but backwards. And we had a limit of 16mb on the file. <br>
		<br>
		We all worked on all parts of this project but my main focus was getting 
        the encryption and decryption working. <br>	
		<br> And I did not own a MAC so working with team members who had MACs after COVID hit was a challenge 
		to keep our project cross-platform. <br>
		<img alt="awards" src="../Portfolio/senior_2.gif"
							width="706" height="302"> <br>
		Ofcourse this was not secure enough to be practical - but it was a fun senior project. <br>
		And interesting when we realized we could hide images, audio, pdf's, and even videos with this tool. <br> <br>
		This is an old animation with broken code - but the finished project looked the same.<br>
		Our client wanted it all done through command line. <br>

	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<font size = "4">
		
		<h5>
		Tri-Tech Skills Center is a trade school for high school students where I learned computer science. <br>
		
		This is on my resume because I spent 30-40+ hours each week 
		working on projects for this program. I was highly passionate about this program. <br><br>
		
		We also did a robotics competition for two years in a row where I learned PBASIC to control these little robots.

							width="500" height="375"> <br>
		</h5>

		<h5>
			
		Instead of describing each project I did at Tri-Tech, my awards will speak for why 
		I believe this is noteworthy of being on my portfolio;
		however, there are some interesting problem solving skills that were involved 
		in each project such as saving and opening files over a network drive to create a multiplayer 
		video game, and I managed 3 other team members over a course of 5 months to create 1 huge project. <br><br>
